# 0x05-python-exceptions

Errors: this include syntax errors which are mostly a typo in your script
Exceptions: this are different class error ->
	:ZeroDivisionError, ValueError, TypeError, IndexError

to handle most exceptions, you use the clause ->
	try: the block of code to execute
	exception: the error raised
	finally: the default statement, executes regardless of errors
