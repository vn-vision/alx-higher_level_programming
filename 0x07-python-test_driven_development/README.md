# 0x07-python-test_driven_development

This directory contains different python scropts and their test cases

The test cases are executed through Doctests and Unittest

Doctest is an inbuilt test framework that comes bundled with python
	: it searches for code fragments that resemble interactive python sessions
	and runs them to confirm they operate as shown
Unittest case has more options compared to doctest: reporting test statistics such as tests that passed and failed
	: it uses methodes created in classes to manage tests.
	it has support for automation, setup and shutdown code when testing.
